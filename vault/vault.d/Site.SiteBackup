text=Running your own version of NatureVault is not hard!%0a%0a!!Download current NatureVault[[#current]]%0aDid you make a page on the wiki and want to save the whole wiki right away?  Make sure you are logged in (password: nature), and click the "Site Dump" link on the left side bar.  It will be in tar.gz and you should be able to open it with a zip program like 7zip.%0a%0aThis gives you only the 'wiki' folder.  This has all the content of the wiki but it is missing the highest level things like site icons and the like.  Use the 'github archive' method below and simply use what you got from this step in the wiki folder of what you get from the github archive.%0a%0a!!Download NatureVault from Archive%0aSimply click the "Github Archive" link on the left sidebar, click 'Code' button and you can either download as a zip file or [[https://docs.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github/cloning-a-repository|clone it]] (cloning allows you to keep an up to date version easier).%0a%0aNext extract the folder.  This is the website in full.  The contents of this would be placed into the htdocs folder (sometimes also called 'www' or 'public') of an Apache web server (like XAMPP, WAMP, Abyss, or your web host).  %0a%0aThis method will give you the full NatureVault site the last time I pushed it from the web server to github.  This might be a few days behind, see the process above ([[#current|download current naturevault]]) to get the latest data straight from the webserver.%0a%0a!!Preparation for hosting [[#prep]]%0a%0aYou will need to make some changes in the [[https://github.com/GiverofMemory/NatureVault/blob/main/wiki/local/config.php|config.php]] file located in the wiki->local folder.  You will need to change the url's specified in this file to point to your correct domains (or local if using the [[#standalone|standalone]] method).
